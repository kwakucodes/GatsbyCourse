The goal of Typography.js is to provide a high-level elegant API for expressing typographic design intent.
Typography is a complex system of interrelated styles. 100s of style declarations on dozens of elements must be in harmonious order. Trying one design change can mean making dozens of tedious recalculations and CSS value changes. Creating new Typography themes with CSS feels hard.
Typography.js provides a vastly simpler way to define and explore typography designs.
You provide configuration to the Typography.js JS api and it uses its Typography engine to generate CSS for block and inline elements.
Typography.js makes it easy to create designs that are unique, personal, and custom to your project.
