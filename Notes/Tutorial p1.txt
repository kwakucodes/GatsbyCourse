Gatsby -> Creating your first project

Once that’s installed, open a new terminal window and run the following commands to create a new Gatsby site in a directory called tutorial-part-one and then move to this new directory:

gatsby new tutorial-part-one https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
cd tutorial-part-one   // For new site just replace the link to your git info and the begining to the new of the file

Before beginging your project, You must start up "gatsby develope" after you name your directory
    This allows you to view it in the browser using http://localhost:8000/

Everything build live once you save it.
You need to develop in a text editor. Gatsby basically allows you to have a personal server
